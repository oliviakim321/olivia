                      Hello! My name is Olivia Kim and I am a second year Mechatronics Engineering student at the University of Waterloo.<br><br>

                      I have a strong passion for technology and development, and enjoy continuously learning and developing new skills.<br><br>

                      I am an avid runner and have participated in several 5ks, 10ks, and half-marathons. I enjoy training and preparing for upcoming races and am hoping to complete my first full marathon by the end of next fall.<br><br>

                      I love adventure and being outdoors, surrounded by nature!<br><br>

                      Among my other interests are all things batman, and a deep appreciation for music. I am currently learning to play the guitar and can also play the french horn.

                I was initiated into the world of code after taking my first programming course at Waterloo.<br><br> I have now developed a strong passion for programming and am experimenting with small personal side projects to broaden my knowledge - this website is one of them!<br><br> I have always enjoyed creating things and developing new skills - making myself busy with small technical projects is a perfect way to do just that.

                  My first programming language was C++, which we used at Waterloo for several programming courses. In my first year, my groupmates and I created "The Catasort" as an end of term project. The Catasort is a candy sorting robot that groups assorted candies by catapulting them into different bins according to their colour. The code for this project was written in Lego Mindstorm's RobotC and the catapult was constructed from lego, spare wood and plastic we found at our school's shop. This was a really fun project that incorporated both mechanical and software design.

                  This website was my first web development project, and, as a result, my first time using html, css, javascript and jQuery. I learned alot and really enjoyed the process of designing and implementing my own ideas. It was a challenge, in the beginning, attempting to create a design compatitble with all device sizes and densities, but was fun to learn and well worth the struggle!

                  Upon the completion of this website, I have begun working on another for a friend. She has a deep passion for photography and wanted to showcase her works on her own portfolio wesbite. Because her photos are so rich in detail and are meant to be the focal point of the site, it's design will be simple and sleek with minimal distracting features.

                  After my first experience with 3D logic at Lockhed Martin, I wanted to learn more, and decided to start game development. I am currently looking into the amazingly well-documented Unity APIs and am trying out the beginner tutorials. I plan to start creating my own basic game in the near future and hope to gain a strong understanding of the core concepts of 3D game development.<br><br> Click <a class="inTextLinks" id="rollABall" target="_blank" href="games/Roll-a-Ball.html">HERE</a> to play my first game, which I developed by following one of Unity's tutorials.

                THE OSC<br>
                  My first co-op term was with the Ontario Securities Commission (the OSC), where I was employed as an IT Service representative. I assisted the employees of the OSC with computer and other hardware related issues.<br><br>
                LOCKHEED MARTIN<br>
                  My first experience with Java was at my previous co-op placement at Lockheed Martin Canada. I worked as a software developer on a virtual training simulation creating 3d logic and animations. This was a great learning experience - I not only picked up a new language, but I also learned some interesting concepts about 3D rendering and graphics.<br><br>
